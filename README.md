Advanced Python/Django ERP application for product, employee and sales registration, detailing, editing, deletion and listing, with access control. Features and evolutions planned can be found in the *Features and Todo List* section.

## Build With

* Python 3.10.11
* Django 4.2.1
* PostgreSQL 15.3.0

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may set up the project locally in your computer. We strongly recommended that you use virtual environments to run the application, we recommend [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (or any other of your choice). Read it, create and activate the virtual environment inside the project folder before steps 5.

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10.11+ installed or do it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) or from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/);
2. Make sure you have Git installed or do it from [Git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/);
3. Access the folder you want to save the project, then clone the repo there
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tjas/tjas-erp
```
4. Access the project folder;
5. Install the project dependencies
   ```py
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Make sure [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is running on your computer and that the ```db_erp``` database has been created. The database access and other related settings must be verified and can be changed in the ```DATABASES``` variable of ```settings.py``` file, located in main application folder (```core``` module).
7. Run the migrations
    ```py
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
8. Run Django project
    ```py
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
9. Then access aplication at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
